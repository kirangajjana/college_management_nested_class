# College Management System
 ### This project is a simple College Management System implemented in Python, using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, particularly focusing on nested classes and nested methods concepts.

## The system consists of three main components:

- University: The main class representing the college.
- Department: A nested class within University representing a college department.
- Library: A nested class within Department representing the department's library.
